      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/headshot.jpeg" class="auth-image" alt="Jeff Emmett">

      <p>IT professional with with 15+ years of broad experience including QA, Business Analysis, Project Management, Product Development and more recent experience with front-end content management, and Web Development for a large financial services firm.</p>

      <p>I am a lifelong learner, which has been demonstrated in the increasing levels of responsibility during my career. I am naturally very creative, and am enjoying my more recent Web Development roles more than at any other time. To that end, I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack (MERN) Flex Web Development bootcamp at the University of Denver, with an expected graduation in February of 2019.</p>

      <p>I am most interested in a Front End Web Developer position focusing on HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery.</p>
